        "about": "The Viral Japanese Yogurt Cheesecake combines Greek yogurt and Biscoff cookies for a creamy, cheesecake-like dessert. It balances fat, protein, and structure without requiring baking, making it easy to prepare. \nYou can customize the cheesecake using different yogurt flavors or cookie types for various twists. To achieve the best texture, use thick, strained yogurt like Greek or skyr, avoiding regular yogurt. This cheesecake can be made vegan or gluten-free by swapping ingredients. \nThis viral hack works because it balances fat, protein, and structure — the same fundamentals behind classic cheesecake  – just without the extra steps. Plain Greek yogurt brings that creamy, tangy cheesecake vibe while the Biscoff cookies  act as a natural thickener, soaking up moisture and giving the mixture its structure. Once it chills, the magic happens ✨. It firms up into a smooth, spoonable treat that feels like cheesecake without turning on the oven or breaking a sweat .",
        "instruction": "Ingredients: \n200 g biscuits,\n80 g melted butter \n400 g thick plain yogurt \n80 g powdered sugar or honey \n10 g gelatin \n50 ml warm milk or water \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional) \n\nInstructions:  \nCrush the biscuits and mix with melted butter, press the mixture into a pan and chill for 10–15 minutes. In a bowl, mix the yogurt, sugar or honey, vanilla, and lemon juice. Dissolve the gelatin in warm milk or water and stir until smooth.",

So when I saw that I could make one of my all time favorite dishes into a low-cal, gluten-free version, I hopped on quicker than a rumour spreads at a high school. \nThis Rice Paper Spanakopita feels like a cheat meal, but has the macros of a gym bro approved lean-and-clean lunch. Only 387 calories, 11 grams of carbs and 34 grams of protein. You could literally eat this every single day without feeling the slightest bit of guilt. Best of all, you only need 10 minutes of prep, then let the air fryer do its thing for another 10. I’m going to need my Greeks 🇬🇷 to take a deep breath when I say this: this Rice Paper Spanakopita may just be lighter, easier and crunchier than the OG.",
